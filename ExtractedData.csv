"Live Smear Test, Q&A With The Nurse & Office Group Discussion",2uceXJ3d6xY,"Live smear test, Q&A with the nurse & Office group discussion 

After meeting with Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust this year, I wanted to do something to help encourage more women to book and attend their cervical screenings here in the UK as statistics had shown that 1 in 4 women skip the cervical screening, with the proportion increasing to 1 in 3 among those aged 25 to 29 and to 1 in 2 in some more deprived regions of the UK. I decided that something I think I would have found really reassuring before attending my first test, would have been to have watched someone else having their test and to understand a little more about it. Therefore, that's what I decided to do! Loaded with your questions from instagram, I took my camera (and Maddie and Lauren who filmed for me) into my smear with the absolutely lovely Jenny! Although filming this was certainly out of my comfort zone, I really hope it encourages any of you who feel a bit uncertain, or have simply put it off to call your local GP and book your smear tests. Let me know in the comments if you have after watching this, and please also feel free to share your experiences below too for others to read.

I will also be donating the money raised from Adsense on this video to Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust! If you'd like to make your own personal donation so they can continue to do the amazing work they do for women across the UK, click here: https://www.jostrust.org.uk/get-involved/donate/make-single-donation

"Live Smear Test, Q&A With The Nurse & Office Group Discussion",2uceXJ3d6xY,"Live smear test, Q&A with the nurse & Office group discussion 

After meeting with Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust this year, I wanted to do something to help encourage more women to book and attend their cervical screenings here in the UK as statistics had shown that 1 in 4 women skip the cervical screening, with the proportion increasing to 1 in 3 among those aged 25 to 29 and to 1 in 2 in some more deprived regions of the UK. I decided that something I think I would have found really reassuring before attending my first test, would have been to have watched someone else having their test and to understand a little more about it. Therefore, that's what I decided to do! Loaded with your questions from instagram, I took my camera (and Maddie and Lauren who filmed for me) into my smear with the absolutely lovely Jenny! Although filming this was certainly out of my comfort zone, I really hope it encourages any of you who feel a bit uncertain, or have simply put it off to call your local GP and book your smear tests. Let me know in the comments if you have after watching this, and please also feel free to share your experiences below too for others to read.

I will also be donating the money raised from Adsense on this video to Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust! If you'd like to make your own personal donation so they can continue to do the amazing work they do for women across the UK, click here: https://www.jostrust.org.uk/get-involved/donate/make-single-donation
